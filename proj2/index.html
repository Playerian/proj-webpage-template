<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
  In this assignment, I implemented the evaluation of the Bezier curve with de Casteljau’s algorithm. Then implemented functions in a mesh editing program that can flip, split, and upsample the mesh. Overall I learned a lot about the algorithm learned in class because I can actually implement and see its effect. 
</p>
<br>


<h2 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
  De Casteljau’s algorithm interpolates n control points into n-1 control points in the 2D space. When this algorithm is used repeatedly until only one point is left, that point is the Bezier curve point lying on the space with those n control points. I implemented de Casteljau’s algorithm by running a for loop that loops through all n control points and calculates the next n - 1 control points and stores them into a vector variable.
</p>

<b>
  Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control points of your choosing. Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
  De Casteljau’s algorithm can be extended to Bezier surfaces by cutting the surface into an array of lines, and do 1D de Casteljau’s algorithm on those lines, then do another final interpolation on the list of the output given by the 1D interpolation. The implementation of this algorithm is separated into 3 parts. The first part of the algorithm calculates the interpolation only once. The second part uses the first part to do a complete interpolation to create a single point. The third part uses the second part to do the first n interpolations along a line, then it uses all those parts and interpolates again to get the final point.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
  I implemented area-weighted vertex normals by summing up the area of triangles around the given vertex and dividing the sum by the total numbers of triangles around the vertex. 
</p>
<br>


<b>
  Show screenshots of dae/teapot.dae (not .bez) comparing teapot shading with and without vertex normals. Use <kbd>Q</kbd> to toggle default flat shading and Phong shading.
</b>
<p>
  The flat shading seems to highlight individual triangles in the teapot which makes the teapot jagged and each triangle is visible even when the wireframe is turned off. Using Phong shading shows continuous color across different triangles which makes the pot more realistic and more clear.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
  I implemented the edge flip operation by drawing a diagram that shows all the elements in the triangle before and after the flip. Then I reassign all those elements from the triangle before to the triangle after.

<b>
    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>
<p>
  My debugging journey is well paved because of the provided resources attached to the spec, so the implementation works in one go.
</p>
<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
  I implemented the edge split operation by also drawing a diagram before and after the edge split operation. This time, I need to create new elements such as a new vertex and some other edges and faces, therefore, there are more pointer reassignments which makes the code harder to check.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
  I follow the guidelines in the spec and follow the steps within. The 5 steps listed in the comments in the function are very helpful for me and I follow its implementation. However, after implementing all 5 steps, the function is not working and it’s showing some weird arrows. I debugged the function by commenting out the steps aside from splitting and flipping, and realized that the edges are not being flipped correctly. After some debugging work, I figured out that this is caused by the edges in the splitting part not being labeled correctly as new. Then, the teapot is splitting and flipping correctly but the new vertex position is still wrong. I debugged this by printing the new positions of the new vertex in the UI, and realized all new locations are 0. After checking the code, I see that the formula I used is int instead of float, so I added a decimal after all the constants and it works.
</p>
<br>


<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
<p>
    After subdivision, the mesh become more rounded around the vertexs. However, if there is a sharp edge or vertex that appears in the mesh, after subdivision it will appears to be more sharp because loop subdivision only move the vertices around other vertices instead of smoothing out the vertices on a sharp edge.

<b>
  Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
</b>
<p>
  The cube is not symmetrical because the edges on each face only have one edge, and when that edge splits and flips it introduces asymmetry because those edges also will be split and flipped. I preprocessed the cube by splitting every edge on the faces of the cube to turn it into an X cross edge, this makes the cube symmetrical when upsampled.
